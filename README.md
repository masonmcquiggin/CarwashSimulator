# CarwashSimulator
A program that simulates an on campus carwash that utilizes stacks and queues to log all the customers who enter on a daily basis and output the data to go with that.

In this program, we're simulating the operations of the FSC Car Wash, a student-run business providing car wash, wax, and vacuum services. Our goal is to manage customer flow using a queue system, ensuring that cars are serviced efficiently within a limited capacity and timeframe. As customers arrive and choose their services, they receive a voucher, which they drop into a box. These vouchers stack up and are later collected by a staff member for record-keeping. The simulation runs daily from 10 AM to 4 PM, tracking each car's waiting time and service completion. We use data structures like queues for the waiting line and a stack for the vouchers to accurately model the car wash's operations, making sure to adhere to specific rules regarding service times, customer arrivals, and the processing of vouchers.
